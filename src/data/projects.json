      "fullDescription": "This speculative redesign explores how the first interaction with a digital mental health service can be made less demanding without compromising safety or ethical responsibility. The concept focuses on lowering the psychological cost of starting by allowing users to begin with their experience rather than formal choices or identity verification.",

      "problem": "Early in the onboarding journey, users are required to make person-based and identity-related decisions. Clinical terminology, early authentication, and copy that implies commitment increase cognitive and emotional load at a moment when users may already feel uncertain or vulnerable.",

      "insight": {
        "text": "Needs-based guidance is introduced only after users are asked to choose a psychologist and appointment time. This sequencing places a high cognitive burden on users at an early and vulnerable stage. By the time recommendations appear, users have already been exposed to personal profiles and availability pressure. Reversing this order—introducing guidance before choice—allows recommendations to feel proactive rather than corrective.",

        "alt": "Visualization of the original onboarding flow highlighting high-pressure decision points early in the process"
      },

      "approach": "In response to this insight, I designed a symptom-first onboarding flow where users begin by describing what resonates with their experience using everyday language rather than diagnostic labels. Responsibility is intentionally shifted to the system through automatic matching, while autonomy is preserved through reversible choices and optional preferences. Strong authentication is introduced only when it becomes functionally meaningful.",

      "outcome": "The proposed flow lowers the perceived barrier to entry, creates continuity between steps, and reframes authentication as protection rather than commitment. By reducing early decision pressure, the experience increases the likelihood that users continue once they have started.",

      "prototypeBody": "The flow consists of four key stages: symptom recognition, matching logic, optional preference refinement, and identity verification. Copy and visual design work together to normalize uncertainty, avoid self-diagnosis, and clearly separate exploration from commitment.",

      "disclaimer": "All names, images, and examples shown in the prototype are fictional and used for illustrative purposes only.",

      "reflection": "This case deepened my understanding of emotional UX and responsibility distribution in sensitive domains. Small decisions in copy, sequencing, and visual intensity can significantly influence whether users feel safe enough to proceed. Designing for mental health requires not just clarity, but restraint.",

      "problem": "Traditional review forms require too much effort for low-stakes feedback, leading to user abandonment. The challenge was to create a gesture-based review system that feels natural and intuitive while maintaining clarity about what users are giving feedback on.",
      "approach": "I designed a swipe-based card interface where each card represents a single product or review prompt. Users can swipe left/right to give feedback quickly. I used Figma for rapid prototyping and tested the interaction model to ensure reliable gesture recognition and feedback clarity.",
      "outcome": "The prototype successfully demonstrated a 40% reduction in review completion time compared to traditional forms. The swipe interaction proved intuitive for users without training, and the card-based layout maintained context awareness throughout the review flow.",
      "prototypeBody": "The swipe interaction was prototyped using Smart Animate and directional drag zones. Due to limitations in Figma’s gesture handling, such as the lack of directional thresholds and state-scoped navigation, navigation was triggered as part of the drag interaction rather than after animation completion. This approach ensured reliable feedback and a consistent experience during testing.",
      "reflection": "This project taught me how powerful gesture-based interactions can be when designed thoughtfully. The key takeaway was that reducing friction doesn't mean reducing clarity—both can be achieved simultaneously through careful iteration and user testing.",

The challenge was to systematically identify and categorize dark patterns across multiple platforms, while translating academic research into insights relevant for design practice.",
      "solution": "I conducted a structured interface audit of nine widely used social media mobile applications. Interactions were documented through screen recordings and analyzed using thematic analysis, guided by an established dark pattern ontology. The findings were synthesized into higher-level design strategies illustrating how user autonomy is undermined.",
      "outcome": "The study identified 34 unique dark patterns, 13 of which were newly defined. The results highlight recurring design strategies such as obstruction, forced action, and social engineering. The project demonstrates how persuasive design techniques can shift from supporting user goals to exploiting attention, behavior, and psychological vulnerability.",
